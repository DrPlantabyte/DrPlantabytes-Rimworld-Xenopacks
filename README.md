# Dr. Plantabyte's Rimworld Xeno-Packs
A collection of Rimworld mods by Dr. Plantabyte that add interesting xenotypes and factions to the game.

## Exoplanet Adaptation

This mod is a collection of xenotypes and factions representing human populations who were forced to change their genomes to survive in extreme exo-planet environments 

### Xenotypes
Many exoplanets have climate fluctuations far more extreme than anything found on Earth. Human colonists on these world must do the previously unthinkable to survive: change their genetics to match their environment.

#### Behinder
The Behinders were "left behind" in a highly toxic landscape. Some of them refused to accept their fate and desparately started injecting any and all known toxic resistance genes into their cells. A combination of genome tinkering and natural selection resulted in a population of humans who are completely immune to toxic pollution and even most chemical weapons, but the slap-dash nature of their genome modifications has left them with a number of genetic deformities and defects, shortening their lifespan.

#### Duster
The Dusters are descendants of humans who engineered themselves to not just survive but thrive on the unearthly hot climates of some exoplanets. Dusters have a very high temperature tolerance and can run very quickly, though they also require more sleep than most humans, heal injuries slowly, and lack the strength to be effective in melee combat. 

#### Farril
Some exoplanets are more hospitable to life than even Earth, yet this is no utopia. On these steamy jungle planets, terraformed plants and animals quickly evolve into gigantic predators that could easily snack on a T-rex. In order to keep their spot as top predator, the Farril humans evolved their own genomes into something much more predatory. They became unnaturally tough and strong, developed camouflaged skin, and grew sharp horns. However, their adapatations also made them impulsive and ill-tempered.

#### Snowy
Whether because of a sudden ice age or bad navigation, the Snowies' ancestors found themselves stuck on an inhospitably cold, dark ice world. Their technology could only keep them warm for so long, so they genetically engineered their children to grow thick, warm fur (and fluffy tails) to keep warm and have sensitive eyes for seeing in through the gloom. The cost of this genetic modification was a significant increase in required nutrition per day and a sensitivity to heat.

### Factions

#### Climate Warlord
The global climate on this exoplanet has been destabilized, and a number of desparate climate refugees have banded together under the banner of a warlord who promised to shepard them through the climate crisis... by extracting supplies and technology from neighboring settlements (rough faction).

#### Snowy Outlanders
A loose confederation of Snowy homesteads and villages (civil faction).

#### Duster Outlanders
A loose confederation of Duster homesteads and villages (civil faction).

#### Farril Hunters
The Farril hunting camps are always hungry (rough faction).



## Spacers

This mod is contains xenotypes of humans engineered for life in space stations and on Urbworlds

### Xenotypes

#### Astro
The first Astros were volunteers for servicing and maintaining critical inter-planetary infrastructure, requiring them to live and work for far longer than ordinary human biology can sustain. Thus they accepted a carefully researched set of artificial genes to allow them to live as normal a life as possible in the vast void.

Astros are resistant to toxins and radiation, and they need less nutrition than most humans, but they move slowly under normal gravity and need more sleep. They are completely hairless, and their photosynthetic skin can be any shade of green, orange, red, or gray.

#### M-Gen
The M-Gens (short for many-generation spacers) have lived in orbital space stations for over a hundred generations. In that time, they've evolved distinct traits by natural selection in such an artificial environment.

M-Gens very rarely get sick and quickly build immunity to disease. They tend to have calm dispositions and keen minds compatible with living one's entire life in a small crowded space. However, M-Gens suffer from a form of albinism that makes them sensitive to natural sunlight and their pain tolerance is distinctly lower than the average human.

#### Syren
Originating from blackmarket gene-labs, the Syren were meant to be the ultimate social influencers, able to infiltrate high-society and be the face of criminal enterprises. However, the gene-set quickly became popular among celebrities and socialites who wanted to make their children as beautiful and popular as possible. A crack-down by law enforcement shutdown the producers of these gene-sets, but their legacy propagates with every generation.

Syren can slowly change their appearance over time, automatically becoming the epitome of beauty in whatever culture they live in, and they are unnaturally sensitive to the emotions of others. However, they were never meant to exist beyond the sterile world of cities and space stations, thus they are fragile and prone to disease.

### Factions

#### The Fallen Stars
Not too long ago, a large passenger star ship full of spacers and stationeers made an emergency landing on this planet. Having failed to find a way off the planet, these former citizens of the stars have had to accept life on the ground (civil faction).
